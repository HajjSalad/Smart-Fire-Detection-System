## ðŸš¨ Smart Fire Detection System
This project showcases a smart fire detection system with STM32 as the sensor node and ESP32 as the fire alarm control panel. It uses object-oriented design in C++ with the Abstract Factory pattern to manage eight modular sensors across fire detection, environmental monitoring, and smart features, enabling clean abstraction and dynamic sensor instantiation.

## ðŸš¨ Smart Fire Detection System
An IoT-enabled fire safety solution featuring:
- **STM32-based Sensor Nodes** for real-time monitoring of fire/environmental parameters
- **ESP32 Fire Alarm Control Panel** serving as both gateway and cloud interface
- **Modular Architecture** using C++ Abstract Factory Pattern for flexible sensor management
- **Edge-to-Cloud Integration** with AWS IoT for remote monitoring and alerts

### ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
- **STM32 Sensor Node** continuously monitor all sensors and communicates with the **ESP32 FACP** via **SPI**.
- **FACP conducts heartbeat checks** - pings the Sensor Node, receiving acknowledgments in normal operation.
- On anomaly, **Sensor Node raises an interrupt**, prompting the FACP to **request detailed sensor readings**.
- **Cloud reporting**: FACP transmits health metrics and emergency events via **MQTT (AWS IoT Core)**.

### ðŸ”§ Key Features
